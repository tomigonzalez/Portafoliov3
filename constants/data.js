      "Hello, I m Tomás González! At 23 years old, I am a passionate web developer specialized in Front-end with React. My journey in the world of programming began as a self-taught person, and since then, I have been in constant search for knowledge and challenges.",

      "In addition to my Front-end experience, I am exploring the world of Back-end, where I use technologies such as Node.js, SQL and MongoDB to create robust and scalable solutions. This diversity of skills allows me to tackle projects from user interface to server logic.",

      "My passion for learning led me to complete specialized bootcamps and I am currently pursuing a university degree to continue deepening my knowledge. I love facing new challenges and learning new technologies to stay up to date in a constantly evolving field.",

      "But my interest is not limited only to code. I also like design and user experience (UX/UI). I enjoy creating designs for my projects using tools like Photoshop and Figma. This combination of technical and creative skills allows me to offer complete and attractive solutions to my clients.",

      "My goal is to continue growing as a professional, facing exciting challenges and collaborating with passionate people. Through my portfolio, I hope to share my journey, my achievements, and my passion for technology and design.",
